= Overview

== Design Concept

The Serial Data Formats (SDF) define compact serialisations for:

* the {openehr_foundation_types}[openEHR Foundation Types^] and 
* the {openehr_rm_data_types}[openEHR RM Data types^].

The intention is twofold:

* to reduce the size and increase the human-readability of JSON-serialised openEHR data;
* to make generation of openEHR data easier.

The formats defined in this specification are mostly re-used from elsewhere in openEHR, and may be expected to be implemented in a standard library for each major implementation technology.
