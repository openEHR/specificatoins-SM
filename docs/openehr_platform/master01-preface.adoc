= Preface

== Purpose

This document specifies core components of the openEHR platform in a formal, abstract form, for use in developing concrete service API definitions such as SOAP, REST, Google protocol buffers and other interface technologies.

The intended audience includes:

* Standards bodies producing health informatics standards;
* Solution vendors.

== Related Documents

Prerequisite documents for reading this document include:

* The {openehr_overview}[openEHR Architecture Overview^].

Related documents include:

* The {openehr_rest_apis}[openEHR REST APIs^].

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_sm_openehr_platform}[{openehr_sm_openehr_platform}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

== Feedback

Feedback may be provided on the {openehr_technical_list}[technical mailing list^].

Issues may be raised on the {component_prs}[specifications Problem Report tracker^].

To see changes made due to previously reported issues, see the {component_history}[{component} component Change Request tracker^].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as a REST API interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.
